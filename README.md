StaySafeCTA 🚇🛡️
StaySafeCTA is a web application built to help Chicago residents stay informed and safe while using public transportation. By entering a starting location and a destination, users can view crime data and safety ratings along CTA routes.

This project aims to raise awareness of local crime and empower users to make safer travel decisions through data-driven insights.
